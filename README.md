## Technology Used

* Express
* MongoDB
* Node

### Why these technologies

These technologies were used for the background as they are convenient and easy to use, we used Express to control the backend setup but using the Express Router to access our json data and to deploy to Heroku. MongoDB was the database used to locally store the json data until it is uploaded into MLAB, and node commands were used to seed the data into the database.

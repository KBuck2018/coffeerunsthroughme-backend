# Coffeerunsthroughme-Backend

### About the project

* This is the group project (Ai Yen, Kevin, and Hyojin) in the Web Development Immersive Program from GA.
* This is the backend component of a full-stack MERN application called Coffee Runs Through Me in which a user can track and compare their daily caffeine intake to other users.
* There is the Express based back-end repository [here](https://github.com/hyojinsarchet/coffeerunsthroughme-frontend)
* It has complete CRUD functionality implemented with RESTful routes.

### Brief Example

### List of Features

* As a User, I want to view my caffeine, so that I can how much I have had
* As a User, I want to edit my caffeine, so that I can add or remove items I have had or not
* As a user, I want to create my own profile, so that I can view my caffeine intake daily
* As a user, I want to view everyone's caffeine intake on one page, so that I can compare my caffeine intake with theirs

### Technology Used

| Back-End |
| :------: |
| Express  |
| MongoDB  |
|   Node   |

### Why these technologies

* These technologies were used for the background as they are convenient and easy to use, we used Express to control the backend setup but using the Express Router to access our json data and to deploy to Heroku. MongoDB was the database used to locally store the json data until it is uploaded into MLAB, and node commands were used to seed the data into the database.
